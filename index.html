                <h2>One of my Favorite poems</h2>
                <p>Joy Harjo is probably one of my favorite poets. Here's something really nice by her from <em>The Woman Who Fell From the Sky</em>.</p>
                <div id="poem">
                    <h3>Perhaps the World Ends Here</h3>
                    <blockquote>The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.<br/> The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation,<br/> and it will go on.<br/> We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They <br/>scrape their knees under it.<br/> It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human.<br/> We make men at it, we make women.<br/> At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.<br/>Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children.<br/> They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put<br/> ourselves back together once again at the table. <br/> This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.<br/> Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow<br/> of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.<br/> We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial<br/> here.<br/> At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and<br/> remorse. We give thanks.<br/>Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and<br/> crying, eating of the last sweet bite.</blockquote>
